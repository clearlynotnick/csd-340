	<p>"How'd you know I was here," Ed asked after he heard Ellis yell his name from the back of the house. "Who else would be driving up in your truck" snorted Ellis. "How'd you know it was my <span id = "truck">_________</span>," continued Ed while he looked around at all the cats that were roaming around the living area. Ellis glared over at Ed, continuing, "I deduced it and you walked in." Ed continued to look around. "How many of them things you got now?" Ellis looked around and said, "<span id = "cats">_________</span>? Well it depends on what you mean by got. Some of them are half wild, some of them are just outlaws."</p>

	<p>Ed continued to look away while Ellis spoke. Once he was done speaking, a moment passed before Ed slowly looked over at Ellis. "How are you doing Ellis?" Without looking away and without missing a beat, Ellis spoke. "You're looking at it. I gotta say...you're looking older." Ed kept a solemn scowl standing upright, resolute, but seemingly stressed. "I am older," Ed spoke. Ellis continued to look at Ed firmly with conviction.</p>

	<p>"Got a <span id = "letter">_________</span> from your wife," Ellis began again without hesitating. "She writes me pretty regular...keepin' me up on the family news...told me you're quittin'?" Ellis' anger began spiking at the end of the sentence, seemingly seething with every last word. Ed breathed out slowly, taking a moment before removing his Sheriff's hat. "You want a cup," Ed finally broke the silence, walking towards the already made <span id = "coffee">_________</span> pot. "'Preciate it," retorted Ellis. Silence held in the air as as Ed trudged over and began pouring the coffee, before stopping and examining the pot. "How free is that coffee?" Ellis rolled his wheelchair towards Ed slowly. "I generally make a fresh pot every week...even if there's some leftover."</p>
